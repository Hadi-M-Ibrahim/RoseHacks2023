# RoseHacks2023
Project name "GreenRide"


This project was nothing short of extremely ambitious. And was filled with set backs. Everything from two out of our three programers having to leave early only being able to attend some of the first day. To our UI/UX designer hustling without sleep to solo the beautiful front end of our app. The adversity we faced taught us more than just programing or design. However, it wasn't all pain and setbacks the comradery built by these past 24 hours easily make this hackathon one to remember and look back upon fondly.
